# Movie-Recommender-System

A Collaborative Filtering movie recommender system is built using the SparkML ALS matrix factorization algorithm, Spark SQL, and Python3. The system is trained and tested on the MovieLens dataset. Cold-start is an issue to the recommender system, which can be solved by taking user feedback. The system outputs top N recommendations based on the user's favorite movie ratings.
